# Python Scripts
This repo provides a list of basic scripts I have created to help with general tasks in my life

## Organize Folder
The script will take in a folder and will organize the files based on if the file is a document or
an image file. Currently, only supports .doc, .pdf, .txt, .png ,but can be easily modified for more 
file extensions.

## File Summarizer
Current script that I am working on that will be able to read in a file such as a .doc, .pdf, .txt and
provide a summary of the files contents.

## Sum of ASCII Values In a Text File
This script is used to read in a text file and sums of each character's ASCII values and then compares each file line to the previous line and outputs the difference the sums. Used this to test the output of another program I created in the repo: [CIS520 Project 4](https://github.com/nwporsch/CIS520-Project-4)
